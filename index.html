      <p>This page will serve to tell you a bit about me, while at the same time
          helping me to learn HTML. Pretty cool, right?</p>
      <p>I've broken it down into three sections, just click on one to jump there.</p>

        <h3><a name="early">Early years</a></h3>
      </header>
      <p>I was born in St. Louis, MO in 1976. I grew up in Hazelwood, MO in
          north county and attended McNair elementary. It was here that I was first
          exposed to coding - I learned some BASIC on a Commodore 64!</p>
          <img src="images/basic.jpg">
      <p>I attended Hazelwood West High School, and after graduation I attended
          Truman State University in Kirksville, MO. I started college as a
          Physics major &amp; a Spanish minor, but Physics didn't work out very
          well for me, so I switched my major and graduated with a degree in Spanish.</p>

      <p>After college, I started a rock band with my good friends and we decided that
         we were going to be professional musicians. I got an administrative assistant job
         at a medical publishing company so I could work 9 to 5 and have weekends off to play shows.
      </p>
      <p>Becoming a financially-viable professional musician (i.e. actually making enough
         money to live on) proved to be more difficult than we thought it would,
         but we gave it a try for 7 years or so. We disbanded in 2006, but I
         continued to play in cover bands until 2014.</p>

        <h3><a name="recent">Recent years</a></h3>
      </header>
      <p>Remember that 9 to 5 job I mentioned earlier? Well, I ended up working there
         for 15 years - the job didn't satisfy me creatively, but it was a steady paycheck
         and I liked the people I worked with. So I stayed. However, in late 2015, my
         company restructured my department and eliminated my position. I was out of a job.</p>
      <p>After wandering and wavering for a while about my future, I decided to apply to
          LaunchCode. And I made it in! So here I am, learning to code and preparing for the next
          chapter of my life.</p>
